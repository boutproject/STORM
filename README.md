STORM
-----

STORM plasma simulation model, built using BOUT++ framework.

This public release version of STORM is designed for seeded filament
simulations in slab-like geometry. The model assumes cold ions, but includes
electron temperature evolution. The current development version, used at
UKAEA/CCFE may have significant features added that are not yet included in
this public release. If you are interested in using features that have not been
released yet, please contact us to set up a collaboration.

This version of STORM has been tested with BOUT++ v4.3.0.
